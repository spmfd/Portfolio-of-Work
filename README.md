## Description

The goal of this project was to build my first website from scratch. As I learn more throughout the course I will be able to add more challenges to my cards for viewing as well as updating the code later on as I learn more.

While creating this website I feel that I have learned leaps and bounds from when I first started. I'll be honest, I didn't really understand flexbox. So, at the beginning of this project I tried to do as much as I could without using flexbox. After getting a marjority of the content inputted into my website I was struggling with how to present it in a way to match the given example. 

At this point I decided to dive into flexbox again by watching some youtube videos (the once referenced below in the credits section), worked with some websites on practice, and did some testing. It really opened my eyes as to the power of flexbox when it comes to website design and application. I went from having no flex boxes to multiple with some additional flex rules inside of the containers for even more customization of content.

Now looking at my final product I truly understand the importance and necessity of flexbox, in regards to website creation. I now feel it is one of the most important CSS elements to master. Once I do master it I will be able to make website look great without that grid feel.
